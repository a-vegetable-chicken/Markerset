The outliner of parameters: "HFSHK_X_N", "HFSHK_X_P", "HFSHK_Y_P", "FFHF_Y_P" were picked out to get the F, P, ES. The original data was recorded accordingly in path "P:\Projects\CMB_innosuisse_shoe_oa\project_only\Multi-segment foot marker set project\Data\V3D_new_processing\SPSS_Res\Original_Data\OUTPUT", and the data after picking out was recorded at "P:\Projects\CMB_innosuisse_shoe_oa\project_only\Multi-segment foot marker set project\Data\V3D_new_processing\SPSS_Res\Original_Data\Pickout_Outliner". 
Also in the file "P:\Projects\CMB_innosuisse_shoe_oa\project_only\Multi-segment foot marker set project\Data\V3D_new_processing\Results_MATLAB_Processing\Outliner.xlsx" can also see the difference.
